1) Briefly describe the purpose of Github.
Github is a repository service.  People use it to keep their code safe, and so many
people can work on the same project without any problems.

2) What does a .ignore file do?
The .ignore file will ignore certain things (which you tell it to) when you commit to
the repository.

3) What is the purpose of branching?
The purpose of branching is so that you can deviate off of the project without ruining the
entire project. 

4) What does the revert command do?
When you commit something you didn't want to, the revert command will do a commit undoing
everything you just did, bringing the state of your repository to the one before.

5) What does cloning do?
It clones the repository to your own computer.
