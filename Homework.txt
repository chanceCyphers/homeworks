1) Briefly describe the purpose of Github.
Github is a repository site that allows people from all locations to contribute to software projects.
Only the owner or authorized users can modify the primary repository for a project, but anyone can fork.
Forked projects can then be submitted to the primary repository for merging if approved.

2) What does a .ignore file do?
.ignore files set up a list of files/folders for git to ignore, i.e. not include in merges, pulls or fetches.
Netbeans or Eclipse caches are examples of files/folders you'd want to include in your .ignore.
However, once a file is tracked, adding it to the .ignore is fucntionally pointless.

3) What is the purpose of branching?
Branching allows a user to work on a specific part of a project without directly affecting other parts.
Within a branch, you can make all the changes you want while the live project performs as it normally would.

4) What does the revert command do?
Revert is used to reverse previous commits, usually faulty ones. The working tree must be clean, meaning no
modifications from the HEAD commit.

5) What does cloning do?
Clone copies a repository to a local directory. It also creates remote-tracking branches in the cloned
repository, forks the cloned repository's active branch and checks out the fork.
