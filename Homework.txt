Name and stuff goes here

1) Briefly describe the purpose of Github.
	Github provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control 
	and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management 
	tools for every project.
2) What does a .ignore file do?
	To stop/ignore files in the git repository from being checked into Github
3) What is the purpose of branching?
	To be able to diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work
	without messing with that main line. 
4) What does the revert command do?
	revert command undoes a committed snapshot. But, instead of removing the commit
	from the project history, it figures out how to undo the changes introduced by the
	commit and appends a new commit with the resulting content.
5) What does cloning do?
	clone command copies an existing Git repository. It has its own history, manages
	its own files, and is a completely isolated environment from the original
	repository. Git cloning automatically creates a remote connection called origin
	pointing back to the original repository. This makes it very easy to interact
	with a central repository.
